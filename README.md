# CCRL 1957 ELO rating
 - BBC 1.2 (is currently getting tested)
 - BBC 1.0 https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/cgi/engine_details.cgi?print=Details&each_game=1&eng=BBC%201.0%2064-bit#BBC_1_0_64-bit

# Testing
If your engine is stronger than 2500 ELO there's no much sense in playing matches<br>
versus BBC for at the moment it would most likely lose all the games.<br>
On the other hand testing versus engines of 2000 - 2300 ELO is welcomed!
